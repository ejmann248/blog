**Response – IG Issues which relate to all Diplo Foundation criteria**

Hi XXX, that&#39;s a good pick up – privacy and data protection is for sure one of the most pressing IG issues in my opinion, and certainly one which captivates governments, civil society and internet users alike.

As to other issues which can also fit that mould, I would also suggest the growing digital divide as critical services become more and more online driven at the expense of their offline counterparts. Here, I&#39;m thinking of [the growth of e-commerce and finance](https://assets.kpmg/content/dam/kpmg/id/pdf/2017/09/id-finance-in-indonesia-set-for-a-new-path.pdf) especially in the Asia-Pacific, where the rise of smartphones and internet access has lead multiple business to take an online-first approach. This is to the detriment of their offline customers, who do not have access to these greater financial opportunities [simply because internet access hasn&#39;t been rolled out in their region yet](https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Locations/Asia/Indonesia/Our%20Insights/Unlocking%20Indonesias%20digital%20opportunity/Unlocking_Indonesias_digital_opportunity.ashx).

Even in Australia, where [the vast majority of the country has decent access to the internet](https://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/8146.0), physical bank branches are closing at [a ridiculous rate](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-01-08/customers-speak-out-after-banks-close-branches-and-atms/10696902). [Entire towns are now without access to financial services](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-06-14/the-town-with-no-bank/9866310), which while no problem for your average Australian, belies the large number of pensioners and people living with disabilities who need a physical location to bank at. This is a problem particularly pronounced in [rural and regional areas of Australia](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-04-24/last-bank-moura-shuts-down-regional-communities-struggling/9691460). It&#39;s all well and good for businesses to seek efficiency gains by closing down physical locations and refocusing on their online business, but it should not be at the cost of accessibility to critical services for a sizeable proportion of the population.

This issue has the infrastructure and standards element as defined by the Diplo Foundation as it relates to critical services (finance/banking) which people rely on. The legal aspect is somewhat dubious, but [our Parliament has taken an interest in the implications of banking branch closures](https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Joint/Corporations_and_Financial_Services/Completed_inquiries/2002-04/banking/report/c04) – indicating that some legal changes may be in the works. There is a development aspect to it also, as it relates to the ability of underserved people to access banking and financial services. Economics is the big one, as people lose out on the ability to make better economic decisions because they are deprived of suitable options for finance. Finally, with the socio-cultural side, these regional banking centres have the potential to employ significant numbers of citizens – leading to an overall reduction in wellbeing across the community.

Let me know what you think, certainly I feel the Diplo Foundation criteria do assist in focusing on the most pressing IG issues.
