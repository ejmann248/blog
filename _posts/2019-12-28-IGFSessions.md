# Elliott Mann – Internet Society IGF Youth Ambassador Report

## Sunday

**Youth IGF Summit**

- During the Youth IGF Summit I participated in group discussion sessions and workshops with the aim of creating a set of youth messages and outcomes to be presented during the proper IGF.
- I was part of the group working on the message regarding critical infrastructure. It was a great experience for me to discuss this important issue with people from other countries and cultures and try to create a message which resonated with us all and would have an impact at the IGF during the week.
- In the end, our group focused on creating a messaged aimed at spurring governments into action and requesting that they do more and are more transparent when it comes to the cybersecurity of critical infrastructure.
- I also enjoyed the opportunity to meet and network with other young people from around the world who are doing work in the Internet Governance space. It was really inspiring to hear what everyone was doing, and I was particularly encouraged to hear of local youth-driven initiatives taking place – that&#39;s certainly something which I will be wanting to take back with me to Australia.

## Monday

**Youth IGF Outcomes session**

- In this session, the attendees of the Youth IGF Summit the day before got together and presented the outcomes and messages created during the workshops. It was a fantastic opportunity to make the youth voice heard and speak with one consolidated voice to the IGF.
- After the presentation of the messages, we all shared the various youth initiatives that we were respectively involved in. On my part, I shared the work on Youth4IG, which is a network of youth and young people in the Asia-Pacific region who have a shared interest in raising the profile of Internet Governance. We aim to communicate and share information about IG opportunities in the region and run capacity building workshops to help people get further engaged in Internet Governance.
- Overall, I was really inspired by the opportunity to hear more about what youth-driven programmes are happening around the world, and there was plenty for me to take back to Australia.

**The Clash of Codes. Conflicts of Laws in Government Data Access and How to Resolve Them**

- In this session, speakers discussed the clash between the need for access to e-evidence in criminal cases, and the need to protect the privacy of data subjects. Here, the distinction was mainly made between the proposed EU E-Evidence regime, and the new CLOUD Act in the United States.
- In the EU, under the proposed E-Evidence regime, authorities investigating crimes can contact data holders in the EU and seek to gain access to the data. This applies even where the investigating authority is outside of the EU, and standardises what has, up until now, been a complicated and bureaucratic process. An interesting hypothetical raised was if the EU would hand over data to an investigating authority where the provision of that data may lead to the death penalty for the data subject.
- In the United States, the issue of data access in criminal investigations resulted in the passing of the CLOUD Act in June 2018. Prior to the CLOUD ACT, foreign governments had raised concerns that e-evidence in local crimes was being held in the US (because of many large technology companies being based in the US). Under prior US law, it was prohibited to allow foreign bodies substantive access to data held un the US. Conversely, and as highlighted in the case of Microsoft Ireland, the US Government faced significant problems in gaining access to data of US citizens held overseas.
- To undo this gordian knot, Congress passed the CLOUD Act, which allows the US government to enter into agreements with foreign governments to allows access to data held in the US. These foreign governments must be rule of law &amp; human rights compliant.
- One interesting perspective presented at the session was that of the German Data Protection Agency, which was largely supportive of the need to access data in criminal investigations. However, the view of the German DPA was that it should not be the role of private organisations to determine if data should be released, and that the right of EU data subjects to exercise their GDPR rights should be upheld.

**Collaborative Leadership Exchange**

- In this session, we were encouraged to share our knowledge about various topics in Internet Governance.
- Most interesting for me was the session on copyright law and its interaction with internet issues. It was great to discuss with the other participants about the differences in our national copyright law, and how our laws have each changed in a reaction to the issues of copyright infringement and user generated content. In Australia, there&#39;s been quite a bit of discussion about how we can reform our copyright law to better reflect the digital age, so it was interesting to hear perspectives from Europe – where a unified approach is being taken across the EU to ensure that the economic rights of creators are protected while also ensuring that digital innovation is encouraged.
- I also got a lot out of the session about encryption. It was interesting to learn about the difference between asymmetric and end-to-end encryption, and how each of them is used in different circumstances. There was also some good discussion about how quantum computing may impact the nature of encryption in the future. It was heartening to hear that quantum computing is not currently at a level which will adversely affect the current nature of encryption.

## Tuesday

**Open Forum – Data Governance and Competition**

- This session discussed the impact of data governance on the digital economy, with a focus on the impact on competition. I was particularly interested to attend this session as Australia&#39;s competition regulator has recently undertaken a Digital Platforms Inquiry which discussed many of the issues addressed by this session. Given the session focused on the current situation in Europe and BRICS countries, it was great to hear the global perspective.
- On the side of the BRICS countries, in those economies it was suggested that a complex economic approach must be taken to the issue of data governance as opposed to a simple economics approach. By complex economic approach, the speaker argued that multisided market theory should be used, alongside with a lesser reliance on price theory and consumer welfare. The primary consideration with economics in data governance was taken to be the leverage of the technology companies over the data of the individuals, and it was suggested that this is where competition regulators should focus.
- From the European perspective, I heard from a member of the German Competition Commission, who reiterated the new European Commission&#39;s focus on competition law and aim to change the basic principles of competition law for digital platforms. The proposed approach to be taken from their perspective was to refocus the conversation to how data can be used to give consumers more choice and competitive ability and focus on how data can be used to encourage service delivery. For example, the example was given of the UK where consumers can easily transfer their banking data from one provider to another – thus streamlining competition between providers. There, the solution to the issue of uncompetitive banks was not to break up the banks, but rather to open them up.
- I really enjoyed this session, and there was a lot for me to take back to Australia – especially as we consider competition law reforms considering the digital era.

## Wednesday

**Youth in IG for Internet ethics &amp; Digital Inclusion**

- I was a speaker in this session which discussed the importance of youth involvement in Internet Governance and ways that youth can get more involved in the area.
- Overall, it was noted that there is more interest in engagement than opportunities. It was suggested that low engagement of youth is not the problem, but rather the lack of opportunity, recognition, trust, and information available for youth to be engaged.
- Participants agreed that there needs to be a focus on developing capacity building programs on a national level, while still having a global perspective, in order to narrow down the lack of knowledge and awareness of the youth. For example, the Youth IGF Summit held prior to the main Internet Governance Forum leveraged the perspective of youth from all around the world to present specific messages on various topics to the IGF.
- Looking ahead, it was agreed that youth programs or initiatives in Internet Governance must be designed in a way that enables multiple exposures for youth. To ensure the sustainability of youth participation and continuous engagement in the Internet governance ecosystem, platforms or channels should be established to network and connect community members among and between stakeholder groups.

**Do Internet Services Deserve a Sin Tax?**

- This session discussed the issue of digital taxation from two perspectives, firstly the concept of a &#39;sin tax&#39; on internet usage, and the overall question of cordate taxation of large technology companies.
- In Africa, the idea of taxing internet services is best exemplified through the example of Uganda, which recently levied 5 cents per day of using social media. The idea behind this levy was an increase in government revenue, and a decrease in gossip and other negative impacts commonly associated with internet usage. The tax resulted in a 30% drop in mobile internet usage, and an overall decrease in government revenue because the telecommunications companies had decreased revenue (as a result of the drop in usage). Accordingly, the panel of speakers in this session considered this a highly regressive tax, as it disproportionately affected individuals who needed access to the internet and was easy to circumvent for more well-off citizens through the use of Wi-Fi or a VPN.
- Regarding the issue of taxing large technology companies, the panel reflected that governments around the world are struggling due to the erosion of the tax base due to lower consumer consumption and the rise of multinational companies which base themselves in low tax jurisdictions. To combat this, the panel suggested a multilateral approach be taken to the issue of high-tech taxation, giving the example of the OECD&#39;s proposed guidelines on base profit tax evasion.
- Overall, I really enjoyed this session and how it gave me a diverse perspective on how taxation issues interact with internet issues globally. The issue of the internet sin tax in Uganda was not one I was familiar with previously, so it was great to hear about the issues faced there. This harkens back to something I really appreciated about the IGF, that being the IGF&#39;s role in bringing together global stakeholders in a manner rarely seen in similar venues.

## Thursday

**EU Delegation &amp; Youth IGF Movement**

- In this session, I heard from members of the European Parliament and representatives from Youth IGF Movements about what can be practically done to encourage youth involvement in IGF-type settings.
- From the members of the European Parliament, it was great to hear how encouraging they were about youth involvement in Internet issues. Usually, you would not expect positions to care about how youth are organising and getting involved in digital issues, so it was heartening to hear that they were genuinely interested and keen to support the creation of opportunities.
- It was also great to hear about the opportunities and IGF events occurring in the Asia-Pacific region. With examples such as Indonesia and India, it was neat to hear that there is some grassroots support for such events in the region.
- It was particularly pertinent for me, as Australia does not currently have a Youth IGF, and in fact our IGF was only recently restarted after a 3-year hiatus. Going forward, I&#39;d love to see an Australian Youth IGF occur, and it was inspiring to hear at this session that it could be a possibility. In this manner, I also appreciated the opportunity to network and meet with leaders of the Youth IGFs, so that I can draw upon them for support in the future.

## Friday

**Information Sharing 2.0: Privacy and Cybersecurity**

- In this session, the panel discussed the balance needed between the release of critical information during and after cybersecurity incidents, with the need to protect the rights of data subjects under privacy laws such as the GDPR.
- The panel observed that currently there is not a privacy law which explicitly allows for security disclosure. It was suggested that any cybersecurity exemption in national privacy law should not be encapsulated in a separate cybersecurity law, but rather included in privacy legislation. It was reiterated that the focus should be on making a cybersecurity exemption under privacy law easy to use, to make it easy for security researchers and response teams to use.
- However, it must be limited, so that disclosure is relational to the threat level.
- Currently, security researchers and responses teams rely on Recital 49 of the GDPR (which allows for national security-based disclosure), but reliance on this provision of the GDPR is limited by the fact that it is focused on network operators.
- It was great to hear the perspective of the Israeli Data Protection Agency, and how their national law has approached the issue of assuring cybersecurity in privacy law. Israel has an adequacy relationship with the EU when it comes to the GDPR, so it was interesting to hear how they have specifically carved out a cybersecurity exemption to their privacy law. This partly reflects Israel&#39;s role as a cybersecurity innovation hub but could also serve as a path forward for other countries.
- I appreciated this session as it was forward looking in its approach to privacy law reform. At the conclusion of the session, I asked a question of the panel about the applicability of other privacy laws other than the GDPR, and it was heartening to hear support for the privacy laws of countries such as Australia and Canada.
