### Book Reviews Part 1 — Sudah baca

As my time in Indonesia comes to a slow close (I’m not actually done until March), I’ve been reflecting on some of the goals I set for myself before I arrived here and some of the habits and changes, I’ve made in the 6 months I’ve been living in Jogja!

Chief amongst those goals was to read more and more widely. Before coming to Indonesia, I’d fallen off the reading train heavily and was keen to get back to reading books not only during holidays but also make a habit of it during daily life. I didn’t really have a specific goal as to how many books I wanted to read, or even what types of books that I wanted to read. In the end I just kept an eye out on social media for book recommendations and made a true effort to make time in my day to read.

As a result, here’s the books that I’ve managed to complete reading since August. I’ve got most of these on my Kindle but have also picked up some in print as I wander around the Gramedia’s and Periplus’ of Yogyakarta. There’s also a handful of books which I’ve started but haven’t finished — I’ll save those for a later post.

### Demokrasi — Indonesia in the 21st Century (Hamish McDonald)

![Prambanan Temple — a great example of Indonesia’s religious diversity](https://i.imgur.com/Jz9K4tf.jpg)

Alright, cards on the table already; I read this one before I came to Indonesia, but I did go through it again when I got here. Found this one as I was looking for a good general overview of Indonesian politics and history and its McDonald’s book ranked high in online lists.

Coming from a background as the former Asia-Pacific editor for Fairfax Media, McDonald presents a view of Indonesia as a state which has gone through unbelievable change and development throughout the 20th Century and is still in a constant state of flux. There’s a great discussion here of power and religious politics which I didn’t really understand until I got to Indonesia and saw the influence of religious organisations and religious thought — particularly with the younger generation.

I particularly appreciated the in depth look at Indonesia’s transition from the New Order to a fully democratic state. Especially in the lead-up to a presidential election in 2019 where there remain questions over whether the move on from the New Order was a good one, it’s fascinating to read about the role of the military, religious organisations and student movements in making Indonesia now one of the most stable democracies in the Asian region.

I’m pretty sure that I now know the main political parties and figures in Indonesian politics, something that’s surprised many an Indonesian when they talk about politics (which is quite often!). I say I’m ‘pretty sure’ I know because there’s also been plenty of times where I’ve understated or overstated a political fact in Indonesia. Coming from Australia, where religious politics exist but not nearly on the same level as Indonesia, I’ve often caught myself over-analysing political situations here for some political purpose when in fact religion is more likely the root cause. The blurred distinction between nationalist and religious political parties is an example of this. Maybe a revised reading of the book with my current understanding would help me with that, but religion and diversity are forces which I did underestimate before I came to Indonesia and I now realise are super persuasive in the political sphere here.

This book predates the 2014 election although there is some discussion of Jokowi representing a new breed of politician not tied to political dynasties. This also means it forgoes any discussion of the rise of identity politics in Indonesia most evident in the [recent Jakarta gubernatorial election](https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2018/12/03/identity-politics-haunts-2019-elections.html). I’ll refrain from a hot take here, but one thing I do want to get out of my last few months here is a better understanding of the [supposed downwards and more authoritarian turn](https://www.newmandala.org/jokowis-authoritarian-turn/) that Indonesia is apparently taking. I guess maybe in Yogyakarta I’m less exposed to politics and certainly the language barrier doesn’t help when trying to read local press but as far as I can see, Indonesia is on a good trajectory from a developing country to a developed one — tackling all the issues that normally rise when a country goes through that process. Of course, I’ll couch this view with the preface that I’ve only been here a short time and am remarkably privileged with the amount of wealth and opportunity I bring to Indonesia. Maybe I’ll come back and finalise those thoughts once I’m finishing up in Indonesia.

Would absolutely recommend this book to anyone interested in recent Indonesian history and it’s a great jumping off point for further readings about Indonesian politics.

The Yudhoyono Presidency: Indonesia’s Decade of Stability and Stagnation (Edward Aspinall, Marcus Mietzner, Dirk Tomsa)

### Tokyo Vice (Jake Adelstein)

So, I initially brought this one while on holiday in Japan at the start of this year but only got around to reading it while here in Indonesia. It’s a memoir about Adelstein’s time as the first non-Japanese reporter at one of Japan’s largest newspapers, the Yomiuri Shimbun. While I was initially drawn to it as a book about crime in Japan, it also has a neat message about being a foreigner in a sometimes-unfriendly country and great insights into Japanese culture both in the workplace and socially.

There’s great insight into Japanese working culture here. I particularly liked the insights into how police and the media interact — there’s a power imbalance as the media dote on the police with gifts and attention and the police provide the media with those all-important scoops. If there’s anything that I felt was off while reading this book it’s that Adelstein himself is always presented as this genius American whose able to overcome any cultural problem, get all the best girls and talk to all the best people. Now, I don’t doubt that he would have had to have been very skilled to be able to work in the job he had, nor do I expect much more from a memoir; but I would have appreciated a bit less introspection or personal focus, particularly in the sections of the book which deal with individual crimes.

The second half of the book revolves around Adelstein’s own personal deep dive into sex trafficking in Japan and how the issue is largely overlooked both in Japanese and Western media. There’s great stuff here, and many of the sections surrounding western women who get caught up in hostess clubs, lose their passport and become effective modern slaves, are shocking and eye-opening. It’s not an issue unique to Japan, but it’s one which is particularly shocking to see in a country which I considered so modern and pristine.

Overall, I came out of reading this with a deeper understanding of how the media and crime systems work in Japan. I’m not planning to live in Japan soon, but I will be visiting and any opportunity to learn about a culture so different to Australia like Japan is super valuable!

Exposure: Inside the Olympus Scandal: How I Went from CEO to Whistleblower (Michael Woodford)

### Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance (ZAAM) (Robert M. Pirsig)

Yet another book which I picked up in the past but never got around to finishing. I brought this on my Kindle at the recommendation of my Year 12 Philosophy teacher all the way back in 2015. It’s a pretty dry read, so I never had the attention span for it in the past, but I took the opportunity of a boat tour in Flores to knock this one out and give it some good reflective time.

![](https://i.imgur.com/Q8lr40o.jpg)

###### Landscapes like this are what helped me get into the philosophy reading zone

Through and through a philosophical novel, ZAAM explores the concept of ‘quality’ and how our differing views of quality affect how we live our life. This is a real base concept of philosophy — so much so that it’s not often discussed because any discussion about quality becomes so broad and vague that no one can ever agree on where to start.

I’ve been out of the philosophy game for a while (approximately since I stopped studying it…) so this was a tough read for me. A lot of the time I felt that I was forcing my way through the book, and I’m sure that a lot of the deeper discussion of quality, and particularly many of the sections relating to early Greek philosophers, went right over my head. As a result, I don’t have any hot takes on the more philosophical parts of the book other than to say that the discussion on quality is one which genuinely has meat on the bone and got me thinking about what are the qualities of the things which I value. Am I more ‘romantic’ or ‘pragmatic’?

I did get through it though, and quite a bit of this book has been rattling through my head particularly as I travel through Indonesia. On the surface, just the way that the author talks about the experience of riding a bike versus an air-conditioned car resonated with me on a recent trip to Lombok where I found myself spending long stretches of the day on a bike riding to various destinations. There really is something more intimate about being in the open air, feeling every bump in the road and leaning into the corners. It’s something that I would’ve taken for granted before reading this book, but it’s something I now appreciate on a deeper level.

![](https://i.imgur.com/qMKpdlj.jpg)
###### Lombok's getting more built up, but it's still 100x better than Bali!

Overall, I don’t know if I recommend giving this a read unless your super keen on philosophy (in which case you probably know and have already read this book). There’re some good insights on life and how to approach things in here, but it’s couched in so much dense and bland language that it’s a bit of a slog.

The Most Good You Can Do: How Effective Altruism Is Changing Ideas About Living Ethically (Peter Singer)

### On Mutiny (David Speers)

I, like many Australians, watched in horror the events that unfolded in Canberra during August. With many thanks to [ABC News’ YouTube live stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSTH5sBWcVQ), I moved from class to cafe in an effort to find good internet which would allow me to just sit in despair as the Government tore itself apart.

[As has been said since](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2018/nov/08/malcolm-turnbull-on-qa-former-pm-in-first-interview-since-leadership-coup-politics-live), I think the fact that no one seems to be able to explain why Malcolm Turnbull was thrown out reflects a political culture in Australia which hasn’t seen a Prime Minister complete a full term since Julia Gillard. The 24-hour news cycle, constant polls and hyper-polarisation of parties is making them trigger-happy to chuck out a leader. Even here in Indonesia, it’s humorous that Australia’s political leadership is so unstable compared to many Southeast Asian states.

On Mutiny is an account of the August coup from David Speers, the Political Editor for Sky News. A short novella, it only took half an hour to get through but does go some way to explaining the background to Peter Dutton’s coup and how Dutton ultimately lost the final vote. Released in October, there’s still questions over the long-term impact of the coup (see Julia Banks) but Speers goes into exhaustive detail about the day by day of what happened that week and makes Parliament House come alive with details about MPs kitchens and hidden passages (I’m only half kidding about the passages).

There’re some hot takes here about Turnbull failing in not giving Tony Abbott a cabinet position and failing to appreciate the fears of conservatives that a focus on climate change and ‘left’ issues would lose votes across middle Australia. While I’m sure that these were reasons why he eventually got rolled, I think characterising them as ‘failings’ is a bit presumptive given what we’ve seen in the Wentworth by-election and the Victorian State election where these sorts of issues have clearly resonated with the electorate.

Ultimately, the book is short enough and cheap enough that you’ll know yourself if you want to know more about that crazy week in Australian politics. There is genuinely some deeper insight here, and the mechanics of the Liberal Party are laid bare for all to see. Of course, if Malcolm Turnbull’s subsequent media appearances have taught us anything, there’s still plenty that we don’t know and that we’ll probably never know.

### Billion Dollar Whale (Tom Wright & Bradley Hope)

Picked this one up at Yogyakarta Airport before flying out to the MotoGP in Kuala Lumpur, started reading in the departure terminal, continued on the plane, train from the airport and finished within 2 hours of arriving at my hotel. A tale which needs to be read to be believed, this book tackles the 1MDB scandal in Malaysia which has [brought down a government](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-44063736), [started criminal investigations in over half a dozen countries](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/malaysian-financier-low-taek-jho-also-known-jho-low-and-former-banker-ng-chong-hwa-also-known) and caused [Goldman Sachs to be the lowest performing stock on the Dow Jones in 2018](https://www.wsj.com/articles/goldman-ceo-defends-firm-on-1mdb-accusations-11545421486).

###### Kuala Lumpur was my opportunity to catch up on all the pork and noodles I'd been missing in Indonesia.

A tale which spans from the secretive banks of Switzerland to the jungles of Borneo, this is a meticulously researched book which lays bare the struggles of newly developed states to avoid graft and corruption in a globalised world where new capital is so easy to come by. This isn’t a story which I feel could only happen in Malaysia. The Brunei Royal Family’s internal struggles are [well documented](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2011/07/prince-jefri-201107), and [Indonesia is still dealing with the aftermath of a culture of graft and corruption during the New Order](https://sydney.edu.au/news-opinion/news/2018/08/31/the-challenge-of-eliminating-corruption-from-indonesia.html). There’s a lesson to be learnt here for foreign banks and foreign governments to be more circumspect of the risks and threats in these emerging markets. An anecdote about how Goldman Sachs in Singapore overruled its own risk assessment of a 1MDB bond sale just shows how little banks have evolved since the financial crisis and how much more work there is to do.

Interestingly, while much of the coverage of 1MDB in the international media [focuses on Najib Razak and the syphoning of funds from 1MDB into his personal accounts](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/business-37241725/pm-najib-named-as-malaysia-official-1-in-1mdb-scandal), this book focuses on the character of Jho Low. Jho Low, from a moderately well-off family in Penang used charm, connections and a killer smile to find himself in charge (officially or unofficially depending on who you ask) of a multibillion-dollar sovereign wealth fund. According to the authors, he then siphoned off millions of dollars of funds to support his extravagant lifestyle rubbing shoulders with famous actors, models and politicians. It’s ironic that 1MDB money was used to finance the Martin Scorsese film *The Wolf of Wall Street* because Jho Low’s lifestyle and deception doesn’t seem that far removed from that of Jordan Belfort.

Perhaps misplaced, I do feel some hesitation about the pure negative characterisation of Jho Low as a greedy businessman who single-handedly has dragged Malaysia into a domestic and international crisis. [The guy’s no angel](https://edition.cnn.com/2018/12/17/asia/1mdb-jho-low-intl/index.html), I understand that, but the lack of media focus on Jho Low versus Najib Razak or Goldman Sachs indicates to me that while he’s a central figure in the 1MDB saga, responsibility for it all can’t lie solely on him. Jho Low never held an official position in 1MDB (although he had plenty of influence) and a lot of the evidence tying him to the worst fund stealing is based on pseudonyms which he might have used in internal emails.

I’ve always been circumspect of profiles of individuals which are predominantly negative since reading Jung Chang’s fascinating book *Mao: The Unknown Story* which while meticulously researched and in depth, is clearly written with an agenda to make Mao the most terrible person ever to walk the earth. Now, I’m not getting into whether that is the case or not, but I feel it’s more important in this age than ever to be wary of the agendas of the people behind the media you consume, and I think in the case of Jho Low, the authors play a little too much into the big bad guy narrative. Again, he’s not a saint, but I wanted to hear a perspective other than just him being wholly responsible.

One of the most fascinating books I read this year, and about a story which I had no idea about before the Malaysian Election and the subsequent arrests and indictments of those involved. Certainly, approachable and a book you won’t be able to put down!

Bad Blood (John Carreyrou)

### The Internationalists (Oona A. Hathaway and Scott J. Shapiro)

I don’t normally read books about law; I get enough law readings just from doing law classes! However, this one came highly recommended from my International Criminal Law lecturer here at UGM as more of a history book as opposed to anything about black letter law. Indeed, *The Internationalists*, is mainly a history of how the world came to criminalise war and a reflection on the fact that contrary to popular belief, our world is safer today than it has ever been.

![](https://i.imgur.com/mRj55KO.jpg)
###### Demolished this book during my East Java trip

I absolutely adored the first third of the book explaining how warfare worked prior to World War One. There’s a great section about Hugo Grotius, widely considered the father of international law, and his attempts to justify war for the Dutch East India Company. War was always considered a key element of state diplomacy and was the default method to resolving state disputes. Casus bellis were flimsy and symbolic in nature — existing only to provide some legitimacy to those states who were willing to declare war to get what they want. So, given that war was such a key part of a state’s diplomatic arsenal, why then do states so rarely declare war these days?

Hathaway and Shapiro take a different tack to many scholars and argue that the Paris Peace Pact of 1928 was the beginning point of the criminalisation of war and crimes against peace which continued through the Nuremberg Trials, establishment of the United Nations and the establishment of the International Criminal Court. Unlike the League of Nations, the Paris Peace Pact was signed by most states around the globe and forbade them from committing aggressive war — effectively criminalising it. Of course, it didn’t quite work out as planned. Not even a decade later, most signatories were at war with each other once again in an even bigger conflict. However, there’s a thesis here that the criminalisation of war forced states to find other ways of hurting each other, leading to the widespread use of sanctions which we see today.

What I didn’t expect out of this was the deep dives into the individual law scholars who fought for and against the case of war. People such as Hersch Lauterpacht, Carl Schmitt and Salmon Levinson who have had such a part to play in ensuring the criminalisation of war deserve to be recognised for their contributions to international law, and it’s great that they all get their time in the sun here.

The final section of the book gets academic as Hathaway and Shapiro argue that the Paris Peace Pact is **the** reason that the number of interstate (the number of civil wars has interestingly stayed constant) conflicts has gone down. They present some great data arguing that since 1928 such a reduction can be seen and there’s some great analysis of justifications for war from various governments, but I’m not convinced of the totality of their argument. I think it’s a bit much to rely mainly on the Peace Pact as the primary reason for a reduction in state conflict. We live in a more multilateral world than ever, there’s regional associations such as the EU, ASEAN and the African Union which ensure that peace is maintained, and more effective enforcement mechanisms to resolve disputes between states (for example, the International Court of Justice). For sure, these may have all come about because of the criminalisation of war but there’s multiple other factors here; not least that states understand more than ever the destructive nature of war and are keen to avoid it.

Other than that, there’s a fascinating history here of the development of international law, how international norms propagated from Europe to Asia and a decent discussion at the end of why the actions of Russia in Crimea threatens this rules-based system going forward. A recommended read for anyone with even a slight interest in international law or international diplomacy.

East West Street (Philippe Sands)

### The Great Game (Peter Hopkirk)

Central Asia is absolutely the big unknown for me and a definite destination on my bucket list. I don’t know what it is to me that makes Central Asia so attractive, maybe it’s the great skiing in Almaty, the rapid development in research & development in Uzbekistan or the growth in democracies throughout the region. I do believe that Central Asia is the next Middle East or Southeast Asia and if I ever end up living that exotic expat life then Central Asia is at the top of my list. This was my Lombok trip book, and there’s nothing like reading about massive deserts and vast plains when sitting on beautiful Indonesian beaches.

![](https://i.imgur.com/bFuc0u8.jpg)

###### I wonder if they have buffalos in Central Asia?

Unlike the Middle East or Asia, there isn’t a great amount of current literature about the recent history, politics or economics of the region — particularly since the fall of the Soviet Union. If anyone has any recommendations, I’m more than open to hear them. As a result, I was pointed in the direction of this history of Central Asia during the ‘Great Game’ between Britain and Russia during the 19th Century as a good background to the region today.

Well-founded or not, there was a real fear by the British that Russia would attempt to expand its sphere of influence in South Asia such as to eventually invade and take over India. Consequently, both Britain and Russia rushed to expand their spheres of influence over the Central Asian tribes, Persia and anyone in between.

While Russia still today states that there was never any such intention, the possibility of a European threat to India didn’t seem too far-fetched in the 19th Century when just recently, Napoleon had tried to invade India via Egypt but abandoned the invasion at the last minute. Hopkirk presents a meticulously detailed tale of brave adventurers, scheming bureaucrats and the decedent shahdoms in between. There’s a whole bunch to learn here about Central Asia geography and I have a better understanding of the diverse cultures and conflicts which have raged in the region for centuries.

It’s a dense read. The complicated web of geopolitics even between British India and London is difficult to get your head around and the sheer number of political agents reflects the complex nature of the ‘Great Game’ itself. By the end though, you get a new appreciation of these modern explorers, who put their lives at risk for Mother Britain and valiantly built relationships with foreign leaders from vastly different cultures. These explorers whose aim was to form alliances and expand spheres of influence area are of a breed not just limited to Central Asia. Much of the same thing happened here in Indonesia as colonizers sought to expand their spheres of influence by forming alliances through flattery with local sultanates. It’s a tragic power imbalance, and I feel that Hopkirk comes down on the right side of it as he explains how shahdoms were constantly betrayed by either Britain, Russia or both and sidelined in favour of grander political goals.

Of course, this is all written in a time when Central Asia was still part of the Soviet Union. As a result, it’s difficult to draw much through line to the current political situation in Central Asia. One reflection I did have though is that China doesn’t feature much at all in Hopkirk’s writing. This isn’t surprising, as during the 19th Century especially, China was hampered by a lack of industrialisation and a not fantastic ability to control its own foreign affairs. Today however, the reality couldn’t be more different. China is perhaps the dominant player in continental Asian politics and the growth in the Belt and Road Project is one of the biggest political issues in Central Asia. While there’s still some cultural and linguistic links to Russia throughout Central Asia, you only need to look as far as the number of states changing from a Cyrillic to a Latin alphabet to see that there’s a desire to be more independent throughout Central Asia.

A hot take would be that we’re seeing the emergence of a new ‘Great Game’ between China and western states (I’m including Russia here) who are vying for influence in Central Asia and its natural resources. China has the money advantage here, we’ve already seen that in Southeast Asia and the Pacific with crazy loans, but I think that the West can offer more intrinsic benefits such as technology or development aid which China will struggle to match. This Great Game won’t have intrepid explorers trekking in the desert to convince Shahs to join an alliance, but it will be fought on economic and development lines.

As a result, while *The Great Game* was a fascinating read, I don’t think it quite gave me the insight I was looking for. The geographical and cultural information was cool, but I want to be looking forward at what Central Asia can be, based on what it is now. There’s some great reflection to be had here about the influence that superpowers can have on smaller and less powerful states, and that’s certainly something which is relevant now. Central Asia freaks should read this one (and probably already have) but for everyone else, it’s not an essential read.
