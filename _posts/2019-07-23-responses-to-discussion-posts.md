**Response – What does Internet Governance mean in Bhutan?**

Hi XXX,

I really liked your emphasis on the use of the internet having to be both socially minded and ethical. I think a lot of the time, discussions about internet policy can get caught up in how we can utilize the most up to date technology, as opposed to how we can &#39;best&#39; use the technology itself!

It&#39;s interesting to hear that Internet Governance is still young and growing in Bhutan; do you get the impression that IG in Bhutan is being formed with knowledge gained elsewhere in the world?

For example, in Australia we&#39;re looking to restart our regional IGF, and to do so we&#39;ve reached out to other countries who have shared knowledge about what worked (and didn&#39;t) for them so that we can make our event the best it can be. Is something similar happening in Bhutan, either from other regional countries or maybe from larger IG bodies?

**Response – connecting the rest of the world to the Internet**

Hi XXX,

Thanks for your post and for breaking down the stats behind the frankly *insane* amount of people still not connected to the internet.

I totally agree that these &#39;unconnected&#39; deserve to be connected to the internet, and this digital divide will only get worse as the internet becomes more and more powerful and pervasive.

Here&#39;s an example of this digital divide in Australia. One of every Australian&#39;s favourite topics of conversation is how much we distrust/hate our banks. Australia&#39;s banking system since 1990 has been [a government-endorsed oligopoly](http://fsi.treasury.gov.au/content/PublicInformation/Pressreleases/PR090497.asp) whereby the &#39;Big Four&#39; banks hold over 90% of Australia&#39;s banking deposits and business. This naturally hasn&#39;t been great for the everyday Australian, and over the last few years there has been [many a story of banking misconduct](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-02-04/banking-royal-commission-report-at-a-glance/10777188) which has horrified Australians. Consequently, [the best banks in Australia](https://mozo.com.au/expertschoice/australias-best-banking) aren&#39;t the &#39;Big Four&#39; but the smaller banks which actually care more about their customers. Unfortunately, many of those banks are online-only, and don&#39;t have any branches or physical presence.

There&#39;s a big problem with this, specifically the lack of accessibility based on distance. Australia, believe it or not, is a big, big, country; and even through the majority of the population live on the coast in large cities, there is a large disparity between these people and those who live in the &#39;outback&#39; – inland from the coast. For those people, they are deprived of the best financial services as they rely on satellite internet ([which has its own problems](https://www.computerworld.com.au/article/658364/nbn-co-sky-muster-satellite-service-hit-by-outage-telco-says/)) which creates a big financial divide between those in the cities with stable and cheap internet, and those living in the outback with unstable and expensive internet. So, I think even in Australia, we&#39;re seeing some of that digital divide which arises when the internet becomes more persuasive.

As to a possible solution, I suspect you and I differ in where the support will come from to fix this gap. I just don&#39;t see private interests, whether it be Facebook or Elon Musk, being able to fill this gap. While Zuckerberg started off with the admirable aim of using the technological ability and reach of Facebook to increase access to the internet, the perverse incentive of increasing Facebook&#39;s market share and influence quickly took hold and ruined any good intentions which may have existed. We only need to look as far as the [Philippines](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/daveyalba/facebook-philippines-dutertes-drug-war), [Myanmar](https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/06/21/facebook-keeps-failing-in-myanmar-zuckerberg-arakan-army-rakhine/) and [India](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/12/facebook-free-basics-india-zuckerberg) to see that Facebook&#39;s corporate interests will quickly take over any altruistic intentions. I&#39;d rather Facebook or Elon Musk divorce themselves entirely from the equation and instead donate their funds to NGOs or development projects which support the development of infrastructure in developing states; as opposed to building private infrastructure which will only be used to serve corporate interests.

This is also an area where governments can, and should, step in. I recognise the problems which often arise when [governments have tighter control over the internet](https://newnaratif.com/journalism/weaponising-the-internet-in-thailand/share/xuna/6425d167c06fe773378b10b546b6e923/), but here I&#39;m focused on the raw infrastructure which allows for internet access – not control of the internet itself. Here, I&#39;d highlight the work done in [Indonesia](https://www.thejakartapost.com/life/2019/05/18/indonesia-has-171-million-internet-users-study.html) where the Government is investing billions in infrastructure in recognition of the development which comes with connectivity right across the country. [Internet penetration in Indonesian is growing by more than 20% per year, with the majority of this coming through wireless smartphone connections.](https://www.pwc.com/id/en/cpi/asset/indonesian-infrastructure-stable-foundations-for-growth.pdf) Much of this investment is through public-private partnerships, which provide the capital for the infrastructure to occur; but also that there is government oversight to ensure private interests do not take over.

In this manner, I don&#39;t believe private interests can improve access to the internet without ultimately being to the detriment to greater society. To me, the way forward is through public investment, through public infrastructure and global support.

**Response – Indonesia Regional Governance**

Hi XXX,

Thanks for sharing about the regional IG issues in Indonesia. I know the pain of the Indonesian internet filter all too well as (even though I&#39;m from Australia) I studied at UGM in Jogja last year (Fakultas Hukum) and kept running into blocked sites!

There is an interesting juxtaposition between the state of the internet in Indonesia and that in Australia though. I spent my last month in Indonesia working in a law firm in Jakarta, and it was quite eye-opening how Indonesia&#39;s internet regulation is simultaneously heavily regulated, and not regulated at all. On the one hand, you have the [UU ITE](https://id.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undang-undang_Informasi_dan_Transaksi_Elektronik) (sorry the link is in Indonesian), which ostensibly governs electronic transactions in Indonesia but in many cases is [actually used to crack down on &#39;online defamation&#39;](https://newnaratif.com/journalism/silenced-by-an-elastic-law/share/rwznaa.rz/69833d7ad0615412561182132fb0d5da) whatever that means. On the other hand, you have the current state of Indonesia&#39;s Data Protection and Privacy Regime ([something I have a keen interest in](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/elliott-mann-au_icann64-activity-6512982024163295232-J0W_)) which is fragmented through multiple regulations all enforced different ways and by different ministries. I&#39;m still holding hope for [the new Data Protection Law to be passed this year](https://www.kominfo.go.id/content/detail/18859/menkominfo-beberkan-urgensi-ruu-perlindungan-data-pribadi/0/berita_satker), but as I&#39;ve discovered when investigating the Indonesian Parliament, nothing is ever certain! Svaradiva, I&#39;d be interested to know if you feel the same way coming from the registry side – as it all just seems very fragmented and confusing to me, although I still hold great hope for Indonesia&#39;s technological advancement!

In Australia, our government also has the issue of cracking down on the internet and wider technology. Most recently they passed an [&#39;anti-encryption&#39; bill](https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/05/australia-rushes-its-dangerous-anti-encryption-bill-into-parliament/) granting the government unprecedented powers to [force companies to install backdoors into their software without notifying users.](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/dec/08/australias-war-on-encryption-the-sweeping-new-powers-rushed-into-law) Naturally, this bill has been met with disapproval from our [Law Council](https://www.lawcouncil.asn.au/media/media-releases/unprecedented-and-complex-encryption-access-laws-must-not-be-rushed-nor-politicised) and the [Australian Computer Society](https://ia.acs.org.au/article/2019/encryption-bill--rushed-laws-blasted.html) as it clearly harms the trustworthy and decentralised nature of the internet. The IG community in Australia is also surprisingly small, and we haven&#39;t held a local IGF in over five years. There&#39;s barely any grassroots efforts at the university level, and I appreciate your point about knowledge sharing from the senior generation because that&#39;s a sore point in Australia also.
