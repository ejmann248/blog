# The Growing Digital Divide in Australia

## Introduction

Access to the Internet continues to be one of the foremost Internet governance issues. While much of the discussion on this issue focuses on the goal of increasing Internet penetration in developing and underrepresented regions, the issue of Internet access still exists in developed countries.

Recognised as one of the United Nation&#39;s Sustainable Development Goals1, access to ICT (and consequently the Internet) is quickly being seen as an important tool in human development and an important factor in improving economic equality. As people gain access to the Internet, they also gain access to the combined wisdom and knowledge of the Internet, financial tools and information, and the ability to communicate with peers all around the world. This empowering nature of the Internet also gives rise to another related issue, the concept of a &#39;digital divide&#39;. As more individuals gain access to the Internet, firms are encouraged to take an &#39;Internet-first&#39; approach and direct their focus on those Internet users. This can have the effect of marginalising individuals who do not yet have access to the Internet, restricting their ability to access critical services. This reflects the thematic area of &#39;Access&#39; as defined in the first Internet Governance Forum held in Athens in 20062 and &#39;Access&#39; as a key Internet policy principle.

Most recently, the issue of a digital divide has arisen in Australia.3 Despite a population of only 24 million people, Australia is one of the largest and most sparsely populated states in the world. As a result, Australia faces unique challenges in extending sufficient Internet infrastructure to its population and ensuring that there is not a continuing digital divide amongst its population.4

This essay will examine the current digital divide in Australia, and the historical factors influencing the divide in the present. This will include specific evaluation of the National Broadband Network and its aim to &#39;bring Internet to all Australians&#39;, as well as a focus on how Internet advancements are having a negative impact of rural and regional Australians.

## Historical Internet Penetration in Australia

Australia has been an early participant in the Internet from the establishment of the Australian Computer Science Network in the 1970s and the delegation of the .au ccTLD in 1986.5 Since then, the Australian Government has taken a liberal approach to the telecommunications industry, allowing competition between service providers by allowing them to create and deploy their own Internet infrastructure. This was balanced by the establishment of Telecom Australia (now Telstra) as a state-owned corporation which ran its own fixed-line phone and Internet infrastructure, thus providing a baseline service against all private competitors.6

Australia faces unique challenges in Internet penetration owing to its large size, sparse but concentrated population and isolation from other counties. As will be discussed later as to the National Broadband Network, it has proven difficult for governments and private sector to ensure everybody in Australia has equal access to the Internet.

Historically, Internet access in Australia has been driven by households with children under the age of 15, with statistics from the Australian Bureau of Statistics showing that in 2004-2005 nearly 73% of these households had access to the Internet compared to only 48% of the households without children under 15 having access to the Internet.7 This has risen in 2016-2017 to nearly 95% of households with children under 15 having access to the Internet, with only 82% of households without children under 15 having access to the Internet. This reflects a generational shift in technology usage by young people, as they use the Internet at school, have smartphones, and are much more Internet aware.

These trends have plateaued over the last three years, as the penetration of Internet into these homes with children begins to reach saturation point. As a result, this key demographic of households without children should be the focus of efforts to improve Internet access in Australia, alongside other areas which are not easily statically broken down.

## The National Broadband Network

Most significantly in the last two decades has been the rise of the National Broadband Network as a representation of Australia&#39;s push towards complete Internet penetration and a narrowing of the regional digital divide.

Promoted by the newly elected Labor government in 2007, the National Broadband Network is an ambitious project to build a Fibre-to-the-Premises (FTTP) network connecting all Australians, both urban and rural, on an equal footing. The NBN breaks with the status quo of the government allowing the private sector to drive Internet infrastructure improvements, by establishing a Government Business Enterprise named NBN Co, to fulfil the project on behalf of the private sector.8 Initially, the NBN was projected to cost up to $43 billion and take 8 years to be completed. Ultimately, in establishing the NBN, the Government recognised private investment in Internet infrastructure is not sufficient to extend Internet access to all Australians and thus required public intervention.

There was also a demographic element to the NBN, which reflected Australia&#39;s growing population and highlights another benefit of universal Internet access. Australia has a rapidly growing population, but much of the growth in concentrated in the large cities on Australia&#39;s east coast. This has led to concerns about overpopulation, poorly planned physical infrastructure and the decline of rural and regional Australia as population centres. As a result, one impetus for the NBN was to extend fast Internet to these rural and regional centres so as to capitalise on the rise of remote work, and to encourage new &#39;smart&#39; creative and technical industries to flourish in these areas.

Of course, as so often is the case with large government infrastructure projects, over the last decade the scope, cost and accessibility of the NBN has changed dramatically with change of governments and economic conditions. The NBN will no longer connect all Australians with FTTP, but rather utilize a &#39;multi-technology mix&#39; of fibre backbone infrastructure and existing technologies to complete the network. Particularly for rural and regional areas, NBN Co has launched two &#39;Sky Muster&#39; satellites to provide Internet access in these areas. These satiates have become the main source of Internet access for a large part of the Australian population outside of main regional centres, but still are subpar in service compared to traditional fixed-line Internet services. A 2016 survey of nearly 2,000 households by the Better Internet for Rural, Regional and Remote Australia (BIRRR) found 88 per cent of customers did not have satellite services which met their needs.9 Satellite users were paying an average of $15.96 per gigabyte, with those in particularly remote areas paying up to $70 per gigabyte. This lies contrary to the aim of the NBN as a motivator for people to move to these rural and remote areas for work on the same terms of the city, as satellite simply cannot compete with fixed-line services.

Consequently, even with government investment in Internet infrastructure, there are still access gaps and difficulties faced by large proportions of Australians. This hampers the narrowing of the digital divide, as Australians with satellite are not on equal footing with those who rely on fixed-line services.

## Underserved Demographics

This divide in infrastructure is exacerbated by a demographic divide between younger and older Australians when it comes to access to the Internet. Here, we can refer to the annual Australian Digital Inclusion Index published by Roy Morgan and funded by a collection of Australian ISPs.10

This index is made up of three different dimensions which track different aspects of digital inclusion; access, affordability and digital ability. Access refers to the ability of individuals to access the Internet, and the availability of devices which can access the Internet. Affordability refers mainly to how much data individuals can get for their dollar and how much Internet services cost as a whole in proportion of our income. Digital refers to digital skill levels, attitudes towards technology and people&#39;s confidence in using it.

The index shows that people aged 14-49 years all have similar rankings of digital inclusion, with people aged 50-64 measuring on average slightly below those younger. However, there is a dramatic drop off in digital ability with people over the age of 65, with an average digital inclusion ranking more than half that of the national average. The 2018 report identifies that this age gap has widened every year between 2014 and 2017.

As an underlying reason for this age gap, the report notes with the expansion of the NBN coming to an end by 2020, the question of access is not so important when it comes to connecting elderly Australians. Rather, the biggest issue faced by this demographic is the rising proportion of income spent on Internet access and lack of digital capacity building. Particularly for those in rural and regional areas, and as foreshadowed above with Sky Muster, Internet access is prohibitively expensive for a demographic which does not require comprehensive access to the Internet. People in the 65+ age bracket generally prioritise access to communication applications such as email or social networking, so it is unreasonable to expect them to pay the same amount for access as someone who is running an Internet business.

On the digital ability front, more work needs to be done to firstly help the elderly feel confident in their use of the Internet and secondly, to equip with basic cyber safety skills which protect them from bad actors. In 2018, research from the Australian Office of the eSafety Commissioner revealed around 2.7 million Australians aged 50 years and over have little or no engagement with the online world.11 This gap was primarily psychological in nature with there being a major &#39;fear factor&#39; surrounding the use of the Internet given negative press surrounding data breaches and crime. Perhaps unintuitively, the research showed that given the opportunity, many of these older Australians greatly wish to learn more about the Internet but do not have access to courses or assistance to do so. The research also revealed that while 50 per cent were happy to use online resources, 72 per cent of older Australians prefer face to face, one on one coaching.

Despite this, there is no focused national program from the government which would assist with this issue. On a local level, some success has been seen in programs which combine high school students with older Australians in workshops which teach the elderly the basics of technology, such as how to access email and use a printer.12 These programs should be rolled out nationally, with the ultimate goal being deeper Internet access in this demographic, and an overall narrowing of the digital divide with older Australians.

The eSafety Commissioner also found that older Australians are more likely to fall prey to scams if they are not taught to be tech savvy. Julie Inman Grant, eSafety Commissioner, stated at the release of the report that &quot;We know anecdotally that older Australians can be a more trusting generation—our research bears this out, with 40 per cent of those aged 50 and over experiencing a computer virus or being the victim of a scam, credit card or personal information theft&quot;.13 This highlights that any education or teaching of Internet skills should also focus on cyber safety capacity building, particularly in this vulnerable demographic.

## Critical Services

Most pertinent to the unique nature of Australia as a large and sparsely populated state is the lack of access to critical services for Australians as a result of this growing digital divide. This issue operates within the framework established by the Diplo Foundation, whereby Internet governance issues can be mapped onto five baskets in line with the areas discussed in the report of the Working Group on Internet Governance. These five baskets are:

1. Infrastructure and Standards
2. Legal
3. Development
4. Economic
5. Socio-cultural

This issue of a lack of critical services in Australia due to the digital divide meets all of these baskets as it relates to how the Internet infrastructure in Australia has not been developed equally across the country to meet the demands of individuals. The development and socio-cultural elements arise in this issue as lack of Internet access disproportionately affects poor and disadvantaged people. In terms of the legal basket, there continues to be attention on the issue from a government standpoint, particularly as Internet access is key to Australia&#39;s ongoing e-government initiatives. The negative economic impact of the digital divide is also seen through the continuing disadvantage faced by poor and underserved Australians who cannot access economic activities due to lack of access to the internet. As a result, this digital divide particularly with regard to critical services represents an internet governance issue.

Focusing on the impact of the digital divide on access to public sector services, recent research has revealed the negative developmental and economic effects of a lack of access to the Internet for disadvantaged people. In research from the Tasmanian Council of Social Services (TasCoSS) in 2018, it was revealed that in the state of Tasmania, there were more than 28 suburbs and towns where more than 20 per cent of homes were without Internet.14 These are low-income areas, raising the issue of how lack of access to the Internet, and the digital divide can exasperate social and economic problems. In Australia, to access social security and to apply for government support programs, you require access to the Internet. The TasCoSS report highlights that for many individuals in these underprivileged areas, they are not equipped with the technological skills needed to effectively use the Internet, even if they did have access. This demonstrates that while access to the Internet continues to be a problem in Australia, especially in isolated parts of Tasmania where fixed-line Internet is not available and satellite access continues to be expensive, any push to expand access must be match by an education program. In a somewhat backwards move, in response to the TasCoSS report, the Tasmanian Government announces that individuals could apply to report their income and support activities via phone, and they would be expanding free Wi-Fi and Internet access in government buildings.

This lack of access to the Internet also strikes beyond government programs and extends to a growing lack of access for rural and regional Australians to financial services. Across Australia, bank branches are closing down at a rapid rate15, with entire towns now without access to financial services. It is considered that this is due to the rise in online banking amongst the general population, which makes maintaining physical bank branches more costly and less profitable. Such a perspective, however, belies the large number of pensioners and people living with disabilities who require a physical location to bank at. Particularly in rural and regional Australia, customers greatly benefit from having physical access to financial services as they organise support for their business and as banks play a crucial role in the local community.16 While banks should be free to seek efficiency gains by closing down physical locations and refocusing on their online business, but it should not be at the cost of accessibility to critical services for a sizeable proportion of the population.

This issue is compounded by the already discussed issues of Internet access and cost in rural and regional Australia, and it is welcome to see that the Australian Government is investigating the issue of bank closure in regional areas.17

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the issue of a digital divide and lack of access to the Internet is still live in Australia. Although Australia has been an early adopter of the Internet, and there are key demographics which demonstrate satisfactory Internet penetration, there are distinct demographics and regions which are hampered by the continuing digital divide.

The National Broadband Network was an ambitious government project which promised to level the playing field and provide fixed-line Internet to all Australians, but ultimately has devolved into a multi-technology mix which disadvantages rural and regional Australians. Further, the key demographic of older Australians is often left out of conversations surrounding Internet access and the digital divide. Proper education programs which accommodate to the demands of this demographic should be put in place to ensure that these key Internet users are exposed to the full good of the Internet and are equipped with the skills to be cyber-aware and safe.

Finally, the digital divide in Australia has created further problems in access to both public and private critical services. In the public sector, key social security programs require access to the Internet, disadvantaging those without the means or resources to access the Internet. In the private sector, through the example of bank branch closures, further disadvantage and digital divides can be seen with rural and regional Australians.

Ultimately, Australia still has a long way to go in narrowing the digital divide and stands as stark reminder that even highly developed countries face issues with ensuring complete equitable and accessible Internet access.
