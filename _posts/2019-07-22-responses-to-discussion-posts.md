**Response – IG in developed vs developing nations**

Hi XXX, thanks for the insight from your country! I agree with your point that in developing countries the government has greater powers to deal opaquely with private organisations to the detriment of the internet users. I was wondering what the role of the media is in making that clear to the general public. For example, in Australia the role of the government in circumventing data privacy laws and regulations has been extensively covered by our [print](https://www.spectator.com.au/2018/12/anti-encryption-laws-threaten-more-than-crooks-and-terrorists/) and [online](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jul/08/australias-anti-encryption-laws-being-used-to-bypass-journalist-protections-expert-says) press. Are there similar media sources in your country which expose the links between the government and private companies?

Thanks for sharing, I&#39;m genuinely very curious!

**Response – net surveillance in Pakistan**

Hi XXX, that&#39;s super interesting (and a little frightening!).

Do you get the impression that the general public care, or actively try to get around these government restrictions? It&#39;s interesting to me as I see Pakistan as quite a technology-focused country, so I wonder what sort of impact such intrusion in the internet may have on the tech industry.

Certainly in Australia, our government&#39;s laws to restrict the use of encryption in software has [raised calls from the tech industry](https://www.smh.com.au/business/small-business/tars-our-profession-encryption-laws-put-jobs-for-coders-at-risk-20190227-p510hw.html) about a possible impact on jobs and damage to Australia&#39;s international standing.

Keen to hear what you think!
