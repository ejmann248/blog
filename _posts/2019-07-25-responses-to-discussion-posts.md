*As part of the ISOC IGF Youth Ambassador program, we had to be active contributors to a discussion forum where Ambassador candidates discussed internet issues. Here are some of my posts - sorry for not providing context!*

**Response - which one do you prefer, access of internet for everyone, or offline business protection**

Ooh, that&#39;s a good one. I would have to go with the offline business protection through. At the end of the day, the internet has only existed for a few decades, and has been outlived by the offline business which still make up much of our economy today.

Of course, I recognise over time that this will change, and internet access will progress to such a level and such a penetration, that is reasonable to expect everyone to have reasonable internet access. But ultimately, I do feel there should be protections for those who do not yet have access to the internet, and this should include some support for offline businesses.

**Response â€“ building bridges between policy and tech people**

I&#39;d agree 100% with everything here. [Law people and tech people do think in different ways](https://www.forbes.com/sites/markcohen1/2019/05/03/getting-beyond-the-tech-in-legal-tech/#26ca085b16fc), and in practice rarely cross paths. The way forward is absolutely to get some sort of cross-pollination between these two specialities and get some sort of understanding between the two. This is all the more important in Internet Governance, which is very literally the intersection of technical knowledge, and policy.

Bringing this back to academia, one of the best venues for this collaboration is at universities where law people and policy people are (physically) not far apart, and where structured classes can be organised by academics. At Swinburne, we offer a [Legal Technology and Innovation unit](https://www.swinburne.edu.au/study/courses/units/Legal-Technology-and-Innovation-LAW30021/local), which is mainly focused on equipping law students with the technical skills not only to build tools in their own right but also to have the communication skills to engage with technology overall. Classes such as this, and similar classes from the technical side which discuss policy, play a big role in filling that gap.
