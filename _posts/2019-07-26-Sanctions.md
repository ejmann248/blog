# Sanctions

Hi everyone,

A somewhat hot topic over the last few years has been the levying of sanctions on multiple nation states around the world. Here, I&#39;m mainly referring to sanctions by the United States of America as they are probably the most prolific. [You can see a list of sanctions levied by the USA here](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Pages/Programs.aspx). In short, sanctions greatly restrict the goods and services which American firms can offer to individuals and companies in sanctioned companies. This especially effects the internet and tech industries, as many tools used widely around the world are hosted and based in the United States.

Over the last couple of weeks, this issue has arisen again, with [GitHub releasing updated guidance as to how their service abides with US sanction laws.](https://help.github.com/en/articles/github-and-trade-controls) Namely, GitHub has begun to limit access to repositories for users in Crimea, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, and Syria – basically locking them out of the system altogether. This of course gave rise to a number of developers in the affected regions declaring that they would be stopping work on their projects because they live in one of the affected regions ([see this post by a developer in Crimea](https://github.com/tkashkin/GameHub/issues/289), and [this from a developer in Iran](https://medium.com/@hamed/github-blocked-my-account-and-they-think-im-developing-nuclear-weapons-e7e1fe62cb74)).

These restrictions apply even when you are just &#39;passing through&#39; and not living in a sanctioned country, [as some Slack users found out last year when their accounts got deleted based on historical logins from sanctioned countries](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-46642760).

This is starting to factor into business decisions for companies as well, as some cloud service providers are stricter on sanctions than others – see [this great discussion on GitLab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/migration/issues/649) about a proposed switch to Google Cloud and how sanctions need to be considered in the decision making process.

In my mind, this issue touches on some of the internet invariants we discussed last week; including:

- Supporting innovation – [while sanctions in some perverse way may be supporting innovation](https://www.nknews.org/2019/06/north-korea-must-develop-science-technology-to-counter-sanctions-party-daily/), there&#39;s no doubt they hurt developers and internet users in the affected countries. How many people are restricted in advancing and innovating on the use of the internet simply because they&#39;re sanctioned?
- Accessible – Sanctions by their very definition restrict one part of the world economically from another. A key part of accessibility to the internet is the ability of anyone to &#39;get on&#39; and contribute content to existing services. With sanctions in place, this simply isn&#39;t possible.
- Global reach and integrity – Similar to Accessiblity, sanctions risk the fragmentation of the internet. [Partly because of sanctions, Russia is threatening to build its own internet](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/11/russia-passes-bill-internet-cut-off-foreign-servers) – an outcome which is surely not helping the integrity and global reach of the internet.

I&#39;d be keen to hear from others on this topic, and especially keen to hear from anyone who has personal experience with sanctions and how they may have impacted their internet use.

Further, do people feel that this is an issue which can be solved at an intergovernmental level (i.e. United Nations or the International Telecommunications Union), particularly in Internet Policy? [We already know the UN doesn&#39;t approve of the US sanctions regime](https://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=24566&amp;LangID=E), but with the multistakeholder nature of internet governance, is there more of a chance we can lessen the impact on the internet invariants?

Can&#39;t wait to hear your thoughts, and I&#39;m really enjoying engaging with you all on the discussion forum!

Elliott.
